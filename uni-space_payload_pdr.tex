\section{Subsystem Introduction}
The Imaging and Tracking Payload Unit (ITPU) is the scientific payload of the airship, and will be independent of the airship project to a large extent.
The purpose of ITPU is to take aerial images from different positions, acquire accurate position and attitude data and use those combined information to create aerial image maps and extract further information from the images such as terrain height, 3D object recognition and possibly image-aided attitude control and path planning.
This could be used as a learning platform to simulation environment for Low Earth Orbit imaging.

The system is further divided into the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Attitude determination: Usage of advanced data fusion method to facilitate GPS, Gyro, Accelerometer and Magnetometer information, to extract accurate position and attitude information together with reasonable error estimates.
\item Imaging system: A megapixel resolution webcam will provide images in regular timesteps in the order of a second.
The image data will be saved on a SD memory card together with attitude information for offline processing.
\item Communication system: Attitude data and spacecraft telemetry will be transmitted to ground.
We try to achieve high bandwidth transmission that could even allow for image downlink.
\item Image processing software:
Image matching and evaluation will be done on a standard PC after payload recovery or in realtime if the transmission rate can be made sufficient.
There will also be a groundstation that communicates with the spacecraft during flight.
\end{itemize}


\section{Technical and functional requirements}
\subsection{Functional requirements}
\label{sub:Functional_requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Measure absolute and accurate position and pointing angles.
\item Take images in regular steps and save them together with attitude data.
\item Receive and execute basic telecommands such as image capture start/stop.
\item Send basic telemetry data such as position.
\item Combine single image captures to a large area map.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Technical requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Operate in open air environment up to 500~m over ground. In U-Space the module will only fly to a height of a few 10s of meters. However it should be used in higher altitudes for later applications.
\item Operate at 5~V unstabilized input voltage at a maximum power consumption of 2.5~W.
\item Store at least 1000 medium-resolution images.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Expected performance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Operate in image capture mode for at least 15 minutes.
\item Create aerial images with 10cm horizontal resoultion (pixel size).
\item Optional: Extract height information with 0.5m relative and 7m absolute resulution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Preliminary Design}

\subsection{Electronic components}
In this section an overview about the requirements and the planned electronic components is given. In order to achieve the functional requirements mentioned in \ref{sub:Functional_requirements} following components are needed:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Board computer
 \item Accelerometer
 \item Magnetometer
 \item Gyroscope
 \item GPS-receiver
 \item Transmitter/Receiver
 \item Camera
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Board computer}

For controlling the sensors and the camera as well as communicating with the ground station first a standard microcontroller was considered, but as the requirements in \ref{sub:Functional_requirements} state, it is necessary to get a picture around every second. Also the resolution of the pictures should be in the range of some megapixels. Taken this into account, a standard microcontroller would not be able to process these amounts of data fast as well as it normally does not come with a USB-interface necessary for connecting most cameras.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/beagle_bone.jpg}
\caption{BeagleBone board}
\label{fig:beaglebone_picture}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/mini2440_3.jpg}
\caption{FriendlyARM board}
\label{fig:friendlyarm_picture}
\end{figure}

Two options for the microcontroller are considered.
One is the BeagleBone embedded computer \cite{BeagleBone:SRM} (figure \ref{fig:beaglebone_picture}). It is populated with an ARM Cortex-A8 microprocessor running at 500 -- 700 MHz and provides an USB-port, several I{\texttwosuperior}C and serial interfaces. It is capable of running an embedded Linux operating system and therefore able to support a large varity of devices (plugged to the USB-port) and to provide the possibility for sophisticated onboard calculations from a large set of libraries.

The other possible board is the FriendlyARM (figure \ref{fig:friendlyarm_picture}).
It has a 400MHz processor and comes with all necessary interfaces.


\subsubsection*{Sensors}

For sensors it is planned to use the LSM303 \cite{LSM303:datasheet} combined magnetometer and accelerometer and the ITG-3200 triple-axis gyroscope \cite{ITG-3200:datasheet} both from sparkfun. Both sensors have been used during the CanSat-project in Würzburg, hence the group is familiar with working with these sensors. They communicate via an I{\texttwosuperior}C interface with the main board. For receiving GPS information a LS20031 5~Hz GPS receiver \cite{LS20031:datasheet} can be used. It is connected via a serial line interface with the main board.


\subsubsection*{Transmitter/Receiver}

Optional for the communication during the flight mission a trasmitter/receiver module would be necessary. To download not only telemetry and housekeeping data but also images taken by the camera, it has to provide a preferably long range, low power consumption and a hight bandwidth. Therefore a small WiFi-module could be consiered sending in around 2.4 GHz frequency.
%If it is only considered to send telemetry and housekeeping data and receive commands, then a RF-module with lower bandwidth would be sufficient.

We are planning to use two WIFI transceivers with USB connectors.
Those have a data rate up to 54Mbps, wich enabled us to transmit 1.7 raw images per second with 1.3Mpx re\-so\-lu\-tion or about 20 jpeg images, which enabled us live monitoring.
A possible transceiver from FriendlyARM\footnote{\url{http://www.watterott.com/de/FriendlyARM-USB-WiFi-WLAN}} has an output power of 15dBm and a receive sensitivity of -71dBm at a frequency of 2.4GHz.
Assuming near-isotropic antenna gain, the link budget
\begin{equation}
d = \frac{\lambda}{2}\cdot\sqrt{15\unit{dB}+71\unit{dB}} = 1250\unit{m}
\end{equation}
yields a sufficiently high free-space transmission range.
Obstacles and non-isotropic gain may reduce this, but we can assume that the transmission over many 100 meters will be save.


\subsubsection*{Camera}

As high quality embedded industrial cameras are very high priced, it is planned to connect a consumer webcam with a resolution of several megapixels to the USB-port of the main board. It is intended to buy a camera which is supported by the Linux operating system running on the main board. To save weight, the case of the webcam will be stripped as much as possible leaving only the bare camera and electronics. An example of a compatible camera would be the Logitech HD Webcam C525\footnote{\url{http://www.logitech.com/de-de/webcam-communications/webcams/devices/7794}}.

\subsection{Attitude Determination System}
The Attitude Determination System (ADS) measures and estimates position and pointing direction of the payload system.
This is crucial for the further use of recordet images, as it provides the reference system and relative alignment of the taken images towards each other.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/ADS_diagram.pdf}
\caption{Attitude Determination System overview}
\label{fig:ADS_overview}
\end{figure}

In order to produce high-accuracy attitude estimates and compensate for disadvantages of certain sensor types such as drift and noise, we chose to use a variety of sensors and fuse their information to a combined information.
The facilitated sensors will be (see figure \ref{fig:ADS_overview}):
\begin{itemize}
\item GPS receiver: Provides absolute position values, but has much high-frequency noise
\item Gyroscope: Provides accurate relative pointing direction, but has drift.
\item Accerelometer: Provides absoulte pointing relative to the horizon (gravity) and linear acceleration.
\item Magnetometer: Provides absolute pointing relative to the earth's magnetic field.
\end{itemize}

Combined all together, these sensors provide complete information about the module's attitude.
As a fusion method we will use well-understood algorithms, such as the extended Kalman filter.

The fused information will be updated in real-time and stored together with each image snapshot.

For development of the software, a simulation module will be written that feeds simulated measurement data into the fusion algorithm.
By this the performance can be quantified and development gets much faster than with waiting for actual measurement data.

\subsection{Software environment}
Since a Linux operating system is run as a basic software layer, it is planned to deploy the Robot Operating System (ROS) as a middle-ware. This system is a modern framework
for mobile robotic applications. Its main advantage is the interoperability of modules and inter-use of underlying 
layers. This increases the flexibility of future research and overall system robustness. Since ROS is an open-source system along with its packages it is used for knowledge exchange and achievement demonstration in terms of modern algorithms. These algorithms include Simultaneous Localization
And Mapping (SLAM), Navigation and position control, Image processing and many more. This way the IPS could also easily be mounted to different carrier systems and, if desired, be responsible for flight control.

\subsection{Image processing}
The main goal is to take numerous aerial images and combine them into one usable map. This system should then be able
to automatically collect images over a given area and produce an aerial map. A proposed solution
for image matching is described in section ~\ref{sec:algorithm}

\subsubsection*{Image matching}
\label{sec:algorithm}
The proposed solution should be very robust to different illumination conditions and overall image quality, namely sharpness. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Step\\
It is needed to extract common and significant points from all the images in question. Since the images
will be taken in sequence it can be assumed that there will be a high correlation in the neighboring pictures.
Having this assumption an algorithm proposed in {\color{red} [bib-ref]} can be implemented for finding 
Points of Interest (POI) based on histogram leveling. 
\item Step \\
Having a reliable set of POI another technique to match the points together can be used. This part is
computationally intensive. In order to be able to use it in real-time it is recommended to use the Iterative Closest Point
algorithm already implemented and optimized in the Point Cloud Library{\color{red} [bib-ref]}.
\item Step\\
By knowing the difference between two set of points in two consecutive images it is possible to calculate
a very precise transformation matrix. The transformation will be determined by how many points
could be found in the previous step. The expectation in a general scenery and medium resolution picture
is about a 100 points. This would be enough even to compensate for camera deformation.
\item Step \\
As a last step the transformation matrix obtained before has to be applied to the images before combining them into one large array. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Test and Verification of Design}
\subsection{Design Models and Verification Methods}
\begin{itemize}
\item A Development Model (DM) will be built, using a breadboard to connect the electronic components together. System stability will be monitored by sequence of tests. Modifications of the software will be done if needed.
\item If time allows, a Flight Model (FM) will be build, using a custom designed PCB schematic layout. This design would minimize circuit mass, size and internal losses.
\item {\color{red} Image processing and stitching algorithms can be tested with a set of example pictures on the ground before using pictures taken by the payload. The performance of example and taken pictures can then be compared.}

\subsection{Parts List and Costs}
Several alternative hardware systems were evaluated.
One was based on an AVR microcontroller, one on the BeagleBone (table \ref{tab:beaglebone}) and a FriendlyARM board (table \ref{tab:friendlyarm}).
The AVR had the advantage that we have experience working with it, but it seemed uncapable of handling fast picture taking.
